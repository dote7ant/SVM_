# Classifications

This repository contains the results and technical aspects  of the Data Science Core IP "Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid." We will use the following approaches to achieve our objective.

### Approach 1: Random forest classifier
### Approach 2: Ada boost 
### Approach 3: Gradient boost 
### Approach 4: SVM - linear
### Approach 5: SVM - Radial Basis Function
### Approach 6: SVM - polynomial

We will compare the accuracy scores and f1 scores for the above models and rank them on how they perform. We will further challenge our solutions with parameter tuning and rerun the same classifiers.
